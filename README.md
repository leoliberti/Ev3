# Ev3
C++ symbolic manipulation libraries for mathematical expressions

This C++ library was written for the Reformulation-Optimization Software Engine (ROSE) <https://github.com/coin-or/ROSE/>, which is a software for performing symbolic reformulations on Mathematical Programming formulations. While ROSE was the main output of an ANR project (JCJC2007, "ARS"), Ev3 was written in 2005-2006. Both Ev3 and ROSE are scarcely maintained since 2012, so you are welcome to use them at your own peril. They worked reasonably well with compilers and hardware of their time.
